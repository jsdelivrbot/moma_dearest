== README

This app uses data from the Museom of Modern Art (MoMA).  They recently published a CSV on github, https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt, 
and have been kind enough to allow the public access to it.  

Things you may want to cover:

* Bundle

* Run "annotate" in terminal to populate attributes in models

* Run rake <tt>db:create && rake db:migrate</tt>


With more time I will add user sign up, pg_search functionality, and user preferences.
